# habbit-finance-app
Habbit acts as both an educational app and a personalized income tracker that teaches young girls about saving and spending. Users stay involved through tracking their daily expenses and earnings while also learning about money basics, budgeting and spending wisely. Using their newfound financial awareness, young girls are empowered to thoughtfully exercise their financial independence and make wiser and better-informed spending choices. The project was coded for SheHacks 2021.
